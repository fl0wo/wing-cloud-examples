## Next Steps
- A [cloud.Api](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/cloud/api) for creating new lobbies and joining them
- A [inflight functions](https://www.winglang.io/docs/concepts/inflights) to handle the API calls for the creation of new lobbies (Spinning new cloud.Services)
- A [redis database](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/ex/redis) for storing in-memory info of the players and the lobbies

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
wing it main.w
